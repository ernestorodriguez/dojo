## The dynamic 
The Sensei give an initial premise and explain the exercise.
One person takes the editor and discussing the premise with the rest of the team to start the solution. After some determined time (5-10 minutes), the role is changed, and then another person takes the role. The sensei helps with questions to guide the solution.
